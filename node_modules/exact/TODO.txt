[ ]	Services should be able to mixin other services.
[ ]	`mapProps` is terrible within the service definition itself
	[ ]	Services should have expected properties and expose consistent state keys.

[ ]	Naming changes: componentDidMount (and similar) are misleading/confusing. Change to serviceDidMount, etc.
[ ]	To consider: currently services choose their own unique keys - might be better to have components decide that, although that has dawbacks, too.
[ ]	Allow "auto-booting" client-side,
[ ]	`StateService.locals()` seems a bit express-specific in nomenclature. Maybe `StateService.context()` or similar would be better.
[ ]  Need statics
